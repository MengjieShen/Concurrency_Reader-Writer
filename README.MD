# Reader and Writer Problem without starvation

## How to compile and run my program
### First, you need to initiate the program through command lines:
``` ./start -f filename```

a sample could be:

``` ./start -f student.txt```

-f indicates the name of the student record file that you want to load. I have included one sample file called ```student.txt```. Please follow the same structure of the file if you want to load other file.

### Next, you can use the function of reading records and writing records.

use make end 
Please execute after all writers and readers have finished execution. 
It will end the program, print out the program statistics. It will save the updated student record in the filename you specified using interface.
